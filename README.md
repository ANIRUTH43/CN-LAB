Network Topology Design
Components Required:

Computers: 10-15 devices (endpoints)
Switches: To connect the computers within each LAN.
Routers: To connect multiple LANs and form a WAN.
Cables: Ethernet cables for physical connections (if applicable).
Simulation Software: Use Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, or any similar tool.
Topology Configuration:

LAN Configuration:
Create two or more LANs, each with a set of 5-7 computers connected via a switch.
Assign appropriate IP addresses within the same subnet for each LAN.
WAN Configuration:
Connect LANs using routers.
Set up routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF) to enable communication between different LANs.
IP Addressing:
Use private IP ranges (e.g., 192.168.x.x for LAN1, 10.0.x.x for LAN2) to ensure unique addressing across networks.
Message Transmission Simulation:

Use simulation software to send a packet/message from one computer in LAN1 to another computer in LAN2.
Configure routing tables to ensure the packet reaches its destination.

Network Topology Simulation for LAN and WAN

This project involves the creation and configuration of a network topology suitable for both LAN and WAN environments using multiple computers, routers, and switches. The simulation demonstrates the transmission of a message from one network to another.

Objective

Create and configure a suitable topology for both LAN and WAN using 10-15 computers, routers, and switches. Simulate the transmission of a message from one network to a computer in another network.

Topology Design

1. Components:
   - 10-15 Computers
   - Multiple Switches
   - Routers
   - Cables (Ethernet)

2. LAN Setup:
   - Two or more LANs, each connected via a switch.
   - Devices within the same LAN have IP addresses in the same subnet.

3. WAN Setup:
   - Routers connect LANs, forming a WAN.
   - Routing protocols (RIP, OSPF) configured to facilitate inter-network communication.

4.IP Addressing:
   - LAN1: 192.168.1.2
   - LAN2: 10.0.0.3
   - LAN..........

Simulation Process

1. Configure LANs: Assign IP addresses to computers, and connect them via switches.
2. Connect LANs via Routers: Set up routing protocols to manage traffic between networks.
3. Message Transmission: Simulate a message from a computer in LAN1 to LAN2, verifying successful packet transmission.

Usage

1. Open the project in a network simulation tool like Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Load the pre-configured topology file located in the `/topology` folder.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the `/instructions` folder to run the simulation.
